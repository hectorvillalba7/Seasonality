        Seasonality refers to behavioral patterns that repeat during certain times of the year. 
        These patterns can be influenced by:
        - **Economic factors:** Commercial and fiscal activity.
        - **Climatic factors:** Planting and harvest cycles in agricultural products.
        - **Political and social factors:** Recurring events like elections or holidays.

        **Benefits of Seasonal Analysis:**
        - **Accurate predictions:** Anticipate price movements using historical data.
        - **Risk reduction:** Identify periods of high volatility.
        - **Better timing:** Optimize entry and exit points.
